"""SQLite persistence — the ONLY module that opens the DB (core layer, no SDK import).

Two tables (``task`` + ``task_worktree``) with ``ON DELETE CASCADE``; WAL +
``busy_timeout`` + ``foreign_keys=ON`` per connection at bootstrap; version-check
-only migrations via ``PRAGMA user_version`` (opening a *newer* DB is refused).

Derive-on-read (Invariant 4): we store ONLY task records + their per-repo
``(repo_path, branch, worktree_path)`` links. Worktree *existence* is never
persisted — git porcelain is the sole truth for that (consumed in Epic 2).
